TXT/TBOOT Specific:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

begin_launch():
--------------------

tboot_parse_cmdline():
  What to do with the command lines from GRUB. The TBOOT one gets put in the MLE
    and measured by TXT.

get_tboot_call_racm_check():
  No RACMs exist. Put a TODO to add future support if neeed.

set_s3_resume_vector()
  Punt on S3 for now.

if ( !(rdmsr(MSR_APICBASE) & APICBASE_BSP) )
  Taken care of.

copy_e820_map():
  To use and adjust. We will handle this differently.

find_platform_sinit_module():
  Need to do this.

tpm_detect():
  Already been done pre-launch

verify_IA32_se_svn_status():
  TXT only. Not sure where it should happen?
  It seems it is really a prelaunch check and we don't really care.

set_policy():
apply_policy(err):
  TXT only. No VLP for us.

launch_racm():
  No RACMs exist. Put a TODO to add future support if neeed.

txt_display_errors():
  Once logging is operational.

  The pre-launch bits have do this.

verify_loader_context():
  Plan to get module info etc.

prepare_cpu():
  The pre-launch bits have do this.

was_last_boot_error():
  Should do.

prepare_tpm():
  Should do.

txt_launch_environment():
  And onward...

verify_platform():
--------------------

supports_txt():
  Already did it once.

vtd_bios_enabled():
  Need to do.

txt_ests_t ests = (txt_ests_t)read_pub_config_reg(TXTCR_ESTS);
  Need to do.

  Need to do.

txt_launch_environment():

build_mle_pagetable():
